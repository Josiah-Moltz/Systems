FOR BASH:`$help <COMMAND NAME>` will help (ahah) you with a BUILTIN command
This will only work on BASH BUILTINS not commands for the terminal. 

FOR ZSH: `$man zshbuiltins` will LIST the zsh builtins. help unfortunately does not exist

       . file [ arg ... ]
              Read commands from file and execute them in the current shell
              environment.

In general, give the file a full path (./file or smth).
Both zsh and bash will search through $PATH to find file before checking locally

You can force bash to do .profile and .bashrc by typing . .profile and such
