R01 STDERR I barely even know her!
time spent: AHAHAHAHAH

STDIN is represented by 0
STDOUT =\\= 1
STDERR =\\= 2

redirection works as follows: `n>` redirects `n` to whatever follows the command

as far as I understand, '>&n' works as a way to direct stuff into 'n'.
Aparently it also creates a copy of 'n', so whatever you direct won't rewrite 'n'
